  Jaglana Homepage
</h1>

My first simple project built with GatsbyJS. I made it for a restaurant owner as an unexpected gift. Although the site was not accepted, he liked it so much that showing it to him led me to the actual cooperation with the company. In the following months I created an ecommerce site for them. The Jaglana Home site is not fully responsive, but comparing it to my new projects, you can see a great progress in terms of RWD design and accessibility.
